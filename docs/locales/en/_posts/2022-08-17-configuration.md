The Settings screen is divided into 4 sections. Most of the options are self-explanatory, but here are a few additional details.

        If enabled, this option will automatically initiate a media sync 5 seconds after M¬≥ is launched.<br>

      <td><code>Open folder after media sync</code></td>
      <td>
        When enabled, the folder containing the downloaded media for the chosen week will open in the computer's file manager after the media sync is complete.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Quit app after media sync</code></td>

    <tr>
      <td><code>Enable<em>OBS Studio</em> compatibility mode</code></td>
      <td>
        If enabled, this option will tap into OBS Studio to change scenes automatically as needed both before and after sharing media.<br>
        <br>
        <blockquote>
          If enabling this setting, make sure that OBS Studio is configured to use the <code>obs-websockets</code> plugin, which is what will enable M¬≥ to communicate with OBS Studio.<br>
          <br>
          Also, configure all needed scenes for media sharing and stage display in OBS. At the very least, you'll need a scene with a <code>Window Capture</code> (recommended) or <code>Display Capture</code> configured to capture the M¬≥ media presentation window, or the screen on which the media will be presented.<br>
          <br>
          You'll also need to configure all desired stage view scenes, for example:
          <ul>
            <li>a shot of the lectern</li>
            <li>a wide shot of the stage</li>
            <li>the lectern and reader mics together</li>
            <li>a shot of the table</li>
          </ul>

      <td>Select which scene is configured in OBS Studio to capture the M¬≥ media window.</td>

### Congregation sync setup

See the [congregation sync](#/congregation-sync) section for details on what this does exactly and how to configure this section.

        Videos downloaded from JW.org will be downloaded at this resolution, or the next available lower resolution. Useful for limited or low-bandwidth situations.

        This will automatically convert all picture and audio files into MP4 format, for use with Zoom's <a href="assets/img/other/zoom-mp4-share.png">native MP4 sharing feature</a> during <strong>fully remote</strong> congregation Zoom meetings. This includes all pictures and media files downloaded from JW.org, as well as additional media files added by the user or the VO.<br>

        <blockquote>
          <strong>Note:</strong> This option is best suited for <strong>remote-only</strong> congregation Zoom meetings. If conducting either <strong>hybrid</strong> or <strong>regular</strong> congregation meetings, look into using <a href="en/#/present-media">media presentation mode</a> by activating the <code>Enable button to present media on an external monitor or in a separate window</code> option instead, and disable this option.

      <td>
        If this setting is enabled, picture and audio files will be kept in the media folder after converting them to MP4 format, rather than being deleted. This will result in a slightly more cluttered media folder, and generally does not need to be enabled if sharing media through Zoom MP4 sharing.

        By default, M¬≥ will attempt to fetch the current year's text in the language selected previously, in order to display it on a black background when in <a href="en/#/present-media">media presentation mode</a> and no other media is being played. If the automatic yeartext retrieval fails for some reason, or if you wish to display a different background image, you can either use the "Browse" button to select a custom picture, or the "Refresh" button to try fetching the yeartext automatically again.<br>
        <br>
