The media presentation mode is designed for simplicity and to prevent mistakes during meetings.

### Entering media presentation mode

Once you have entered presentation mode, the media presentation screen will automatically appear on an external monitor if present, or in a separate, draggable and resizable window.

The folder selection screen allows you to select the date for which you'd like to display media. If the current day's folder exists, it is automatically selected. You may change the selected date at any time by clicking the date selection button, in the header.

### Presenting media

When in standby, the media presentation screen will display the background image that is configured in the settings. If no background image has been configured, then JWMMF will attempt to automatically display the yeartext on Windows computers.

<blockquote>For automatic yeartext display to work properly, JW Library needs to have been used at least once to display the yeartext on an external monitor. Note that this feature has only been tested on Windows computers.</blockquote>

If all else fails, a black background will be displayed when on standby.

To play media, press the ▶️ (play) button for the file you'd like. To hide the media, press the ⏹️ (stop) button. A video can be paused and played if necessary; note that for videos, the stop button must be pressed **twice** to prevent accidentally stopping a video while it is playing.

### Hybrid meetings

The bottom right has the "power/shutdown" button, which will exit media presentation mode when pressed twice, as well as the "hide/show" button. This "hide/show" button will allow you to quickly hide and show the media presentation screen, which is very practical during hybrid meetings.

Zoom should be configured to be displayed fullscreen on the external monitor, with JWMMF's media presentation window on top of it. When a part is being conducted by a remote participant, press the "hide/show" button to **hide** the media presentation window, so that those in the Kingdom Hall can see the participant.

When the participant has media to show, or is done their part, press the "hide/show" button to **show** the media presentation window.
