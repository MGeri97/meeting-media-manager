This includes all pictures and media files downloaded from JW.org, as well as additional media files added by the user or the VO. <br><br><blockquote>When using the option to share your desktop or an application in Zoom, the video resolution is dependent upon CPU usage, screen resolution, graphics card, and OS graphic system capabilities. Depending on how the video is shared, the overall quality of both the video share and the meeting for the user who is sharing may be affected. <br><br> However, when using the MP4 video share option, Zoom encodes the video from the file directly and shares it, effectively bypassing some of the limiting factors with standard content sharing. Allowing the Zoom client to handle the encoding and sharing minimizes CPU usage for the participant who is sharing, which allows for higher frame rates and smoother video playback for all participants.

This will result in a slightly more cluttered media folder, and generally does not need to be enabled if sharing media through Zoom MP4 sharing.

### Meeting setup

| Setting  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `Midweek meeting` | Indicate the usual day and time for the midweek meeting; used for folder naming and smart music fade-out (see below). |
| `Weekend meeting` | Indicate the usual day and time for the weekend meeting. |
| `Enable button to play Kingdom songs on shuffle`  | Shows a button on the main screen which, once clicked, will play Kingdom songs from the *sjjm* series, in random order. This is useful, for example, to play songs before and after meetings at the Kingdom Hall as background music. |
| `Song playback volume` | Sets the volume at which the background music will play. |
| `Automatically stop playing songs`  | If `Enable button to play Kingdom songs on shuffle` is active, then this setting will allow you to specify a delay after which background music should be automatically stopped. <br><br>This can be either: <li>a set number of minutes, **or** </li><li>a predetermined number of seconds before the start of the meeting (in the case where the background music was started before a meeting).</li> |
