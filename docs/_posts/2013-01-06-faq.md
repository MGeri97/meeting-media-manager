### Does this app depend on external sites, sources or "curators" to download publications and meeting media?

**No.** The app behaves similarly to JW Library. It downloads publications and media directly from the official JW.org website and its content delivery network. At runtime, the app automatically determines what needs to be downloaded, such as media files and publications. The source code is available for all to examine and verify this.

### Does this app infringe the JW.org Terms of Use?

**No.** The JW.org <a href="https://www.jw.org/en/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> actually explicitly allow the kind of usage that we are making. Here is the relevant excerpt from those terms (emphasis mine):

>You may not:
>

(This does **not** prohibit the distribution of free, non-commercial applications designed to download electronic files such as EPUB, PDF, MP3, and MP4 files from public areas of this site.)
