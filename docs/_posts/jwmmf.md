<h3 id="mmm">What is M³?</h3>

<p>Meeting Media Manager, or <strong>M³</strong> for short, is an app for Windows, macOS and Linux, that automatically downloads pictures and videos that will be considered during congregation meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses, in any language
  found on JW.org. It features recurring and custom media management, as well as an optional sync feature for members of the same congregation, as well as support for multiple congregations and/or groups using the same computer account.</p>

<p>M³ also allows you to share and present all meeting media easily. For <strong>hybrid</strong> or <strong>in-person</strong> congregation meetings, the  integrated media presentation mode has all the features needed to simplify the task of sharing media with the congregation, including handy media thumbnails, easy pause/play/stop buttons to manage playback of media files, automatic external monitor recognition, and even OBS Studio integration.</p>

<p> For fully <strong>remote</strong> congregation Zoom meetings, the inbuilt MP4 conversion feature in M³ enables you to share media files of all types easily, using Zoom's native MP4 sharing feature.</p>

<p>This app is made with love and a bit of spare time. Enjoy!</p>

<h3 id="language">Does M³ work in my language?</h3>

<p><strong>Yes!</strong> Media for meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses can be automatically downloaded in any of the hundreds of language that are available on JW.org. The list of available languages is dynamically updated; all you need to do is select
  which one you want.</p>

<p>In addition, M³ itself has been translated into many languages, by many volunteers; you can therefore configure the language you would like to be displayed in M³'s interface.</p>
