# Managing media

If either *Offer to import additional media* or [congregation sync](https://sircharlo.github.io/jw-meeting-media-fetcher/congregation-sync) are enabled, then users will have the possibility of adding or removing media for any given meeting.

The media management screen allows the user to add or remove media for any given meeting, as well as recurring media, if congregation sync is active.


| Scenario  | The media management screen... |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| The *Offer to import additional media* setting is not enabled, and [congregation sync](https://sircharlo.github.io/jw-meeting-media-fetcher/congregation-sync) is not active  | ... will never show up.|
| The *Offer to import additional media* setting is enabled | … shows up after clicking *Get media!* and fetching media from JW.org, but before the MP4 conversion takes place (if enabled). <br>Changed made are local, on your computer only. |
| [Congregation sync](https://sircharlo.github.io/jw-meeting-media-fetcher/congregation-sync) is active | … shows up after clicking the **☁️** (cloud) button on the main screen of JWMMF.<br>Changed are synchronized with all congregation sync users. <br><br>To get the latest version of a meeting's media, as well as any changes or additions made by the VO, users can click on the *Get media* button on the main screen. The sync can be done as many times as necessary. |


### Adding media

Here's how to **add** media:


| Option  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Target meeting  | Choose the meeting for which you'd like to manage media. <br>If congregation sync is active, you'll also have a "Recurring" option, to manage recurring media.<br>After making a selection, the media list shows up. (See below) |
| Type of upload  | To add a file, you'll need to choose from one of the 3 media types. |
| Media to add  | This will show either a menu or a file selection field, depending on the type chosen. (See below) |
| Filename prefix  | Up to 6 digits can be added before the media fileaname(s), to help with sorting. |
| Media list | This shows the currently planned media for the active target meeting. |


In the *Media to add* field, you'll be presented with different options, depending on the media type selected.

| Media type selected | The Media to add field will... |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Song | ... show a menu with all Kingdom songs videos from the *sjjm* series, in the media language. Choose this option to add a song for the public talk, or for circuit overseer visits. <br><br>The selected song will be automatically downloaded from JW.org. |
| JWPUB | ... allow you to browse to a JWPUB file (or drag and drop it into JWMMF). <br><br>You'll then be prompted to select the section or chapter from which you'd like to add media. This will add both embedded and referenced media from that section in the JWPUB file. <br><br>An example of a commonly used JWPUB file is the S-34, but any JWPUB file can be used here. |
| Custom | ... allow you to select any other media file from your computer.  <br><br>If this option is chosen, you may either browse to the file(s) you want to add, or drag and drop the media onto the JWMMF window.<br><br>Note that PDF and SVG files will automatically be converted into high-resolution images by JWMMF. |



### Removing media

To **hide** or **remove** media, simply select a target meeting, and find the file you don't want in the media list. Depending on your situation, here's what to do:

|  | Media has a red "delete" button | Media has a checked checkbox | Media has an unchecked checkbox |
| ------------- | ------------- | | |
| If the *Offer to import additional media* setting is enabled... | Click on the red "delete" button to delete the file from your computer. <br>Click a second time to confirm. | - | - |
| If [congregation sync](https://sircharlo.github.io/jw-meeting-media-fetcher/congregation-sync) is active... | Media was added to congregation sync by the VO. <br>Click on the red "delete" button to delete the file from congregation sync. <br>Click a second time to confirm. | Media is from JW.org. <br>Uncheck the checkbox to hide the media for your congregation's users. | Media is from JW.org, and already hidden. <br>No action is neccesary. |
