### Configuration

The Settings screen is divided into 4 sections. Most of the options are self-explanatory, but here are a few additional details.

#### Application setup

| Setting  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Display language  | Sets the language in which the app is displayed. <br><br>Thank you to our many contributors for translating the app in so many languages! If you want to help improve an existing translation or add a new one, please open up a new [discussion](https://github.com/sircharlo/jw-meeting-media-fetcher/discussions). |
| Folder in which to save media  | All media will be downloaded to this folder for later use.  |

#### Congregation sync setup

See the [congregation sync](https://sircharlo.github.io/jw-meeting-media-fetcher/configuration) page for details on configuring this section, and what it does exactly.


#### Media setup

| Setting  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Exclude all media from the <em>th</em> brochure  | If enabled, this will prevent media from the Apply Yourself brochure from being included at every midweek meeting. |
| Exclude audio and video files from the <em>lffi</em> brochure  | If enabled, this will prevent audio and video files from the Live Forever brochure from being included, for example for student assignments during the midweek meeting. Pictures will still be included. |
| Offer to import additional media |If enabled, you'll be presented with the **Additional media** screen when performing a media sync. That screen allows you to add additional media files into a given week's media. See Managing [additional media](). |
| Convert media to MP4 format | This automatically converts all picture and audio files into MP4 format, for use with Zoom's [native MP4 sharing feature](https://github.com/sircharlo/jw-meeting-media-fetcher/blob/master/screenshots/05-zoom.png?raw=true). This includes all pictures and media files downloaded from JW.org, as well as additional media files added by the user or the VO. <br><br>When using Zoom's native MP4 sharing, files are "opened within Zoomâ€™s built-in video player and shared, without other participants viewing the playback controls. Sharing your video with the built-in player", rather than sharing your entire screen or your media playback app's window, "improves the quality of shared videos, providing a smoother and more stable viewing experience for your viewers."

#### Meeting setup

| Setting  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Enable button to play Kingdom songs on shuffle  | Shows a button which will play Kingdom songs in random order. This is useful to play songs before and after meetings at the Kingdom Hall as background music. |
| Automatically stop playing songs  | If the previous setting is active, then enabling this setting will allow you to specify the period after which the background music should be automatically stopped. This can be either a set number of minutes, or a predetermined number of seconds before the start of the meeting (in the case where the background music was started before a meeting). |
