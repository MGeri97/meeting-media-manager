# 常见问题

## :earth_americas: 此应用是否依赖外部站点、源或“管理员”下载出版物和聚会媒体或其他文档？

\*\*不。\*\*此应用程序的运转方式酷似JW Library应用。 It downloads publications, media and other content directly from the official JW.org website and its content delivery network. The app automatically determines what needs to be downloaded and when previously-downloaded content is no longer up-to-date and should be re-downloaded.

**No.** The JW.org [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/finder?docid=1011511\&prefer=content) actually explicitly allow the kind of usage that we are making. Here is the relevant excerpt from those terms (emphasis mine):
