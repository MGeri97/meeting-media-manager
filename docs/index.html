  <p>JW Meeting Media Fetcher, or <strong>JWMMF</strong> for short, is an app that facilitates the downloading of media that will be considered during congregation meetings of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses. This is especially useful to share media with others
    during congregation Zoom meetings, for use during personal study, or when using JW Library is not possible or feasible for various reasons.</p>

  <p>This app is made with love and a bit of spare time. Enjoy!</p>
