  <h3 id="jwmmf">What is JWMMF?</h3>

  <p>JW Meeting Media Fetcher, or <strong>JWMMF</strong> for short, is an app that facilitates the downloading of media that will be considered during congregation meetings of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses. This is especially useful to share media with others
    during congregation Zoom meetings, for use during personal study, or when using JW Library is not possible or feasible for various reasons.</p>

  <p>This app is made with love and a bit of spare time. Enjoy!</p>


  <h3 id="language">Does JWMMF work in my language?</h3>

  <p><strong>Yes!</strong> Media for meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses can be automatically downloaded in any of the hundreds of language that are available on JW.org. The list of available languages is dynamically updated; all you need to do is select
    which one you want.</p>

  <p>In addition, JWMMF itself has been translated into many languages by many volunteers; you can therefore configure the language you would like to be displayed in JWMMF's interface.</p>
