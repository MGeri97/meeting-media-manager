  <h3 id="jwmmf">What is JWMMF?</h3>

  <p>JW Meeting Media Fetcher, or <strong>JWMMF</strong> for short, is an app for Windows, macOS and Linux, that automatically downloads pictures and videos that will be considered during congregation meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses, in any language
    found on JW.org. It features recurring and custom media management, as well as an optional sync feature for members of the same congregation, as well as support for multiple congregations and/or groups using the same computer account.</p>

  <p>JWMMF also allows you to share and present all meeting media easily, using either its integrated media presentation mode for <strong>hybrid</strong> or <strong>in-person</strong> congregation meetings, or the inbuilt MP4 conversion feature,
    which enables you to share media during fully <strong>remote</strong> congregation Zoom meetings using Zoom's native MP4 sharing feature.</p>

  <p>This app is made with love and a bit of spare time. Enjoy!</p>

  <h3 id="language">Does JWMMF work in my language?</h3>

  <p><strong>Yes!</strong> Media for meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses can be automatically downloaded in any of the hundreds of language that are available on JW.org. The list of available languages is dynamically updated; all you need to do is select
    which one you want.</p>

  <p>In addition, JWMMF itself has been translated into many languages by many volunteers; you can therefore configure the language you would like to be displayed in JWMMF's interface.</p>
