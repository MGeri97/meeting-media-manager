## Help translate this application

If any one of you would like to volunteer to become a MÂ³ language moderator for a language you speak, please [sign into GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/) using your GitHub account, and then let me know by [creating a new discussion](https://github.com/sircharlo/meeting-media-manager/discussions/categories/translations) in the **Translations** category.

As language moderator, you will get notified of changes to the English original strings, have a nice and easy to use interface to review existing as well as untranslated strings in your language, and submit new translations to the repo easily.

The documentation website will automatically be updated when changes are pushed to the docs branch.
