<h3 id="mmm">What is MMM?</h3>

<p>Meeting Media Manager, or <strong>MMM</strong> for short, is an app for Windows, macOS and Linux, that automatically downloads pictures and videos that will be considered during congregation meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses, in any language
  found on JW.org. It features recurring and custom media management, as well as an optional sync feature for members of the same congregation, as well as support for multiple congregations and/or groups using the same computer account.</p>

  <h3 id="mmm">Is MMM just for <em>downloading</em> media?</h3>


<p>No! MMM also allows you to easily share and present meeting media.</p>
<p>For <strong>hybrid</strong> or <strong>in-person</strong> congregation meetings, the integrated media presentation mode has all the features needed to simplify the task of
  sharing media with the congregation, including:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>media thumbnails</li>
  <li>easy-to-use pause/play/stop buttons to manage playback of media files</li>
  <li>easy background music playback, with automatic stop before the start of regularly scheduled meetings</li>
  <li>automatic external monitor recognition</li>
  <li>OBS Studio integration</li></ul>

<p>As for fully <strong>remote</strong> congregation Zoom meetings, the inbuilt MP4 conversion feature in MMM enables you to share media files of all types easily, using Zoom's native MP4 sharing feature.</p>

<h3 id="language">Does MMM work in my language?</h3>

<p><strong>Yes!</strong> Media for meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses can be automatically downloaded in any of the hundreds of language that are available on JW.org. The list of available languages is dynamically updated; all you need to do is select
  which one you want.</p>

<p>In addition, MMM itself has been translated into many languages, by many volunteers; you can therefore configure the language you would like to be displayed in MMM's interface.</p>




## How do I get started?
